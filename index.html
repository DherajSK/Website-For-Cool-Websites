  <h2>About</h2>
  
  <h3><i> Why this website?</i></h3>
  <p > The main goal of this website was to build something useful, productive. Something that will help others getting started with something
    they need help with. We could have also done something like a Reddit,Quora,Imgur post or even a tweet-thread, but a website will remain forever,
    it serves as a stark example of how much hard work it takes to learn something and to use it to do useful work. 
  </p>
  
  <h3><i> How to use this?</i></h3>
  <p> This is a pretty much simple website with no much overhead required to read and parse through this. The main webpage contains links that can be accessed directly,
    provided that the orignal website doesn't get taken down.
   Anymore links or suggestions are always welcome! </p>
   
   <h3><i>Credits</i></h3>
   <p>I should thank <a class="link" href="https://github.com/DherajSK">Dheraj S K</a> and <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Shashank54">Shashank Bhat</a> for helping me make 
     this website. I also would like to give credits to all those people who were creators of the websites and links presented above.
